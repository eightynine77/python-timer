# python-timer
this is a helpful python script for making countdown. you can also make multiple countdowns too!

# how to use
there are two ways to use this script. if you're not downloading from the release package:  
[https://github.com/eightynine77/python-timer/releases](https://github.com/eightynine77/python-timer/releases)  
then you have to download ffplay from [this](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) and then put ffplay into the script's ["resource folder"](https://github.com/eightynine77/python-timer/tree/main/resource) folder.

to avoid this hassle, simply download from the [releases](https://github.com/eightynine77/python-timer/releases) section
